This project has stalled ... however, [knights-templater](https://github.com/funkybob/knights-templater) is more or less production quality now!

Contemplation
=============

But.. doesn't Django _have_ a good template language?

And isn't there already Jinja for faster templates?

Well, yes.  But this was originally a space for me to test and think about [contemplate, if you will] other ways to approach templating.
